Use the Tab key to get to fields that you otherwise cannot see.   If the lab indicates there should be a button or fiels that you need to do something with and you can't see it, try hitting tab a few times to get to it.


## Starting up Skytap<a name="startskytap"></a>
1. Open a browser on your lab machine (Firefox or Chrome seem to behave better than IE)
2. Enter the URL for your Skytap environment. You will obtain this from your instructor.
3. You should see a panel with all eight VMs listed. All the VMs should be in a stopped state.
4. Click the large Start button (not the Start button on the individual VMs).
5. The VMs will spin for awhile.  Be patient and wait for each VM to show a started state.
